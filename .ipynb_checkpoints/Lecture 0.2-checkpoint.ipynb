    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we will learn about function composition.  This will be an important concept needed in later lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key topics that we will cover this time are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  How do we compose functions\n",
    "-  How does function composition allow us to talk about inverse functions\n",
    "-  What are some step we can take to try to find the inverse of a function\n",
    "\n",
    "## Composing functions\n",
    "An important operation that you will have to get used to is the composition of functions.  This will become **extremely important** when you learn the chain rule.  In this section, we will cover how to compose functions as well as how to decompose functions into simpler components.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "If \n",
    "-  $f$ is a function from a subset, $A$, of the real numbers to a subset, $B$, of the real numbers,\n",
    "\n",
    "and \n",
    "\n",
    "-  $g$ is a function from $B$ to a subset, $C$, of the real numbers,\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "then there is a new function that we can construct from $A$ to $C$ called the composition of $g$ and $f$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This function will take an input from $A$ and provide an output in $C$.  The way we construct this function is by saying that when we plug in a value $x$ from $A$, we will first calculate $f(x)$, which will be an element of $B$, and since $B$ in the domain of $g$, we will plug this value into $g$.  Doing so, produces the value $g\\left(f(x)\\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be visualized through the following diagram."
