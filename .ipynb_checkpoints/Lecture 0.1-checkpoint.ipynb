    "**More Complete Definition** - A **function** is a *relation* between two sets $A$ and $B$, that associates **one and only one** output value $y_i$, contained in $B$, to every $x_i$,contained in $A$.  The set $A$ is called the **domain** of the function, and the set $B$ is called the **codomain** of the function.\n",

To the second issue, I would say that these difficulties are not too hard and can be overcome.  You could learn to reasonably approximate the solutions to the equation above using the **bisection method**.  However, since this is not part of the regular curriculum for a calculus course, I feel that you might be frustrated with me for teaching you a method that you will likely never use.  Especially since you have already learned all of the tools (quadratic formula and factoring) necessary to solve such an equation.\n",

    "1)  Since the coefficient on $x^2$ is $1$, the factored form will likely look like $(x\\pm ?)(x\\pm?)$.\n",
